# dokuwiki-headerfooter
A plugin to set global and namespace-specific (local) header/footer files. Use `_header` (local) and `__header` (global).

Example header files are in the root. The "up" link sends you up one namespace and is very useful if you have a lot of namespaces. The local header template only contains a space, so if placed in the topmost namespace, it overwrites the "up" link, because you can't go up further than that.
